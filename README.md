**Wavely** is a mobile application designed for water sports enthusiasts. The app provides real-time information about weather and ocean conditions, including:

- Wave height  
- Wind direction and speed  
- Air and water temperature   
- Cloud coverage  
- Tides  

Everything you need in one app, designed for surfers, kitesurfers, windsurfers, and ocean lovers ✌🏾  

In addition to weather forecasts, Wavely also includes a community where you can make group plans and enjoy your favorite sport.

##  Technologies Used

###  Client  
- Swift & SwiftUI - Full UI construction and user experience design.
- Combine - Reactive handling of data streams and app state.
- MVVM Architecture - Clear separation between logic and views for cleaner, scalable code.
- Core Location - Accurate user location to show nearby beaches and conditions. 
- Swift Data - Local persistence to keep the app working even without internet.
- REST API for weather and ocean data (⚠️ I am currently migrating to a new, more stable and cost-effective API)
    

###  Backend (ServerSide)  
- Firebase – Notifications, storage, and real-time services.
- Supabase – Main database used to store beaches and spots.
- FirebaseAuth – Secure user authentication.
